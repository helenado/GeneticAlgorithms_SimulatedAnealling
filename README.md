# Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Anealling

## Theme: Performance Comparison between Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Anealling

- The genetic operators used were mutation and crossover.
- The Genetic Algorithm was performed to solve a minimization problem of a given function. The method of selection used was the tournament.
- Simulated Annealing was used to solve the same problem and a comparison on the number of iterations and performance was done with the Genetic Algorithm implementation.
